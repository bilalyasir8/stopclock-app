A stopclock (often called a stopwatch) is a timekeeping device designed to measure the exact amount of time elapsed from when it is started to when it is stopped. It is widely used in sports, scientific experiments, and various activities requiring precise timing.

Key Features of a Stopclock:
Start: Begins measuring time.

Stop: Halts the time measurement.

Reset: Clears the elapsed time to zero.

Lap/Split Functionality: Records intermediate times without stopping the overall stopwatch.

Uses of a Stopclock:
Timing races and athletic events.

Measuring durations in labs and experiments.

Tracking intervals during workouts.

Monitoring task durations for productivity.

Types:
Mechanical: Traditional analog stopwatches using gears and springs.

Digital: Electronic devices displaying time digitally with higher precision.

Software/Web-based: Applications or websites that provide stopwatch functions via programming languages like JavaScript.

Modern Web Stopclock:
Can offer precision up to milliseconds.

Often includes features like lap recording, countdowns, and saving time logs.

Uses APIs like JavaScript's performance.now() for high precision.

The hourglass image the user attached symbolizes the concept of measuring time precisely, akin to how a stopclock functions by recording time intervals accurately.
